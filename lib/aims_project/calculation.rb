#
# A calculation is a combination of a geometry, a control file, and an output
# Each calculation runs in its own directory
# A special file named .calc_status in the calculation directory reveals the status of the calculation
# The format of this file is still under consideration.
# possible options are:
#  • A single word indicating the status
#  • A single word on the first line and unstructured text following (for comments, history, errors)
#  • YAML
#
# The calculation progresses through the following state machine
#   STAGED:
#       This is the initial stage, before the calculation has been 
#       moved to the computation server and queued for execution. 
#       Valid inputs are CANCEL, ENQUEUE
#   QUEUED:
#       Calculation is uploaded to computation server and queued for execution.
#       Valid inputs are CANCEL, PROGRESS
#   RUNNING:
#       Calculation is in progress.
#       Valid inputs are CANCEL
#   COMPLETE:
#       Calculation is completed
#       No valid inputs
#   ABORTED:
